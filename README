# php-htmx-todos

This was an attempt at creating a todo list while learning HTMX but morphed into rolling a minimal PHP framework. The UI is not completely finished,
I was ultimately going for a (load more) button versus paginated pages, but that didn't work out quite right, among other things.

From what I understand, HTMX cannot just call an API, it expects formatted HTML to return to the frontend.  I think to make this project fully finished, I would
need some kind of middleware that grabs the API response and transforms it to HTML, ( or alternatively ) I could update the internal API routes to handle this.
